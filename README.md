## General Information
- The idea behind the project is to make a tool for writer to get an initial idea what to write. If writer experiences writer's block, it might serve as an impulse to get thought train going again.
- Function `newPrompt()` provides a sentence which includes the Who, Where and What they are doing.
- I made this project to practice GitHub, Git, writing README file, pushing changes from VS Code to GitGub, working with branches, using Markdown. 



## Technologies Used
- VS Code v1.61.1
- JavaScript ES2015
- Node.js v14.18.0
- git version 2.30.2.windows.1 (Git Bash)


## Features
Ready features:
- calling `newPrompt()` function generates a new **random** sentence every time. Sentence includes three different data sets: Who, Where and What they are doing.  Every data set is randomly chosen from array provided.

Further development ideas:
- incorporate this functionality into webpage
- user activates function with a push of a button 


## Usage
Please run this code on your local machine, on Node.
In your terminal, in working directory `writer-prompt-generator` enter:
`node generator.js`




## Project Status
Project is: *in progress*


## Room for Improvement


Room for improvement:
- Improve the arrays - make bigger lists with more options to choose from
- Incorporate into website
- Make an activation button
